# Tangibles - This Week's Recap
> First off, we made a plans page where we laid out all our ideas and strategies. Then, we came up with a hacks page to show off our smart solutions and clever tricks. We also put together a tangibles page, documenting the real things we've created in our coding adventures. To team up with our partner, we made a post in their repository, sharing our thoughts and updates. And to top it all off, we spiced up our website by tweaking a few things to make it look even better. It was a productive week of working together and making our projects shine!
