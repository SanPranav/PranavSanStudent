# Hacks
>Create a JavaScript snippet below with the following requirements:
>Create an object representing yourself as a person. The object should have keys for your name, age, current classes, interests, and two more of your choosing
>Your object must contain keys whose values are arrays. The arrays can be arrays of strings, numbers, or even other objects if you would like
>Print the entire object with console.log after declaring it
>Manipulate the arrays within the object and print the entire object with console.log as well as the specific changed key afterwards
>Perform mathematical operations on fields in your object such as +, -, /, % etc. and print the results with console.log along with a message contextualizing them
>Use typeof to determine the types of at least 3 fields in your object
