# Partner Post: 
>In our computer science class, my buddy Alex Glaser and I make a great team. We've tackled some tough assignments together, and Alex is awesome at solving problems and coming up with cool ideas. Our teamwork has helped us understand tricky computer stuff and even impress our classmates and teachers with our creative solutions. As we keep going in our computer science journey, I'm sure that with Alex as my partner, we'll keep doing well and reaching new goals.
